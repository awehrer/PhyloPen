Originally described under genus \u003ci\u003eTrachya\u003c/i\u003e, this species has as known junior synonyms \u003ci\u003eTuberella aaptos\u003c/i\u003e sensu Wilson (1902) and \u003ci\u003eProstylissa spongia\u003c/i\u003e de Laubenfels, 1953 (see also R\u0026#252;tzler et al., 2014). There is a great deal of confusion regarding how many species there are in the Greater Caribbean shallow waters, with names such as \u003ci\u003eAaptos duchassaingi\u003c/i\u003e (Topsent, 1889), \u003ci\u003eA. bergmani\u003c/i\u003e de Laubenfels, 1953  and \u003ci\u003eA. lithophaga\u003c/i\u003e (Wiedenmayer, 1977) still to be clarified, plus species recently described from NE Brazil by Moraes (2011), \u003ci\u003eAaptos glutinans\u003c/i\u003e, and by Carvalho, da Silva \u0026#38; Pinheiro (2013), \u003ci\u003eA. hajdui\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eA. potiguarensis\u003c/i\u003e. We found three distinct species of \u003ci\u003eAaptos\u003c/i\u003e growing together in the Florida Bay side of Key Largo, all pictured here, one black, with large spicules (\u003ci\u003eA. pernucleata\u003c/i\u003e), one dark brown and tuberculate, with smaller spicules (\u003ci\u003eAaptos\u003c/i\u003e sp.2), and the third light brown and smooth with slightly thicker spicules (\u003ci\u003eAaptos\u003c/i\u003e sp.3). Following R\u0026#252;tzler et al. (2014), we decided to call the black morphotype \u003ci\u003eA. pernucleata\u003c/i\u003e. On the other hand, our material from the Bahamas concurs with \u003ci\u003eEpipolasis lithophaga\u003c/i\u003e Wiedenmayer, 1977, although our spicules are predominantly true hastate styles instead of the anysostrongyloxea typical of \u003ci\u003eAaptos\u003c/i\u003e and as described by Wiedenmayer (1977). However, its skeletal arrangement coincides with \u003ci\u003eAaptos\u003c/i\u003e. Pending further work and analysis of types, we hypothesize that black \u003ci\u003eA. lithophaga\u003c/i\u003e is a junior synonym of \u003ci\u003eA. pernucleata\u003c/i\u003e regardless of its smaller spicule size, as spicules tend to be smaller in the Bahamas in general and co-occurring morphotypes should be compared instead of relying on absolute size.Rounded masses to thick, sprawling encrustations, up to 10-50 cm in diameter and 2-20 cm thick. Color of the upper exterior black, base and interior cream. Surface generally even, smooth, often covered with sediment, but can be tuberculated, in portions or throughout the body; oscules round, slightly elevated or even, with the black rim contrasting with the surrounding sediment-covered surface, 2-5 mm in diameter. In some specimens, there are narrow meandering crevices, a few mm long and \u003c1 mm in diameter. Consistency tough, rather leathery. Skeleton as ascending, diverging and reconnecting tracts, 4-15 spicule thick, which deep in the choanosome are more sparsely separated but become more crammed towards the surface, where they open up in about 2-3 layers of successively smaller spicules , the topmost one being a palisade of densely packed bouquets of the smaller spicule category. As spicule size varies with geographical location, specimens of areas with larger and thicker spicule sizes show much denser and thicker tracts. When visible, tissue in between ascending tracts with many small spicules strewn in confusion and often with darkly pigmented granular cells.  Spicules in Bahamian specimens are slightly curved styles with smoth to slightly rugose heads and sharp to strongly mucronated tips; a few of the smaller spicules have a narrower head, conforming to anysostrongyloxea. Spicules in other areas are slightly curved anysostrongyloxeas (\u003dfusiform styles) with the thickest portion in the apical half, resulting in very narrow heads and thicker tips, usually slightly telescopic; some heads may be slightly bulging, especially in smaller sizes. Spicules occur in 2-3 size categories, the two larger ones difficult to separate than the smaller one; smaller ones are more frequently true styles. In the Bahamas, the larger two categories are 650-1025 \u0026#181;m long by 3.8-15 \u0026#181;m wide, and the smaller category 330-460 \u0026#181;m long by 2.5-5.0 \u0026#181;m wide. In Florida, Martinique and the continental coast of Colombia spicules reach much larger sizes, the largest categories being 625-1825 \u0026#181;m long by 5.5-54 \u0026#181;m wide, and the smaller 220-520 \u0026#181;m long by 2.5-12.5 \u0026#181;m wide."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00016/00492.JPG","text":"Aaptos_pernucleata_ott2839403"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00016/00493.JPG","text":"Aaptos_pernucleata_ott2839403"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00016/00494.JPG","text":"Aaptos_pernucleata_ott2839403"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00040/01206.jpg","text":"Aaptos_pernucleata_ott2839403"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01905.JPG","text":"Aaptos_pernucleata_ott2839403"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01906.JPG","text":"Aaptos_pernucleata_ott2839403"}]}},{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Suberites aurantiacus","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":32,"attributes":[{"Color":"gray  green  orange  yellow "},{"Location":"mangrove/coastal lagoon "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"branching  lobate "},{"Description":"Also placed under genus \u003ci\u003eTerpios\u003c/i\u003e, and known also as \u003ci\u003eTerpios zeteki\u003c/i\u003e de Laubenfels, 1936.

Oscules aligned usually on top of branches, may be slightly elevated. Sometimes found as clusters of tubes with top oscules. Fully (thinly to thickly to massively) encrusting deep reef wall specimens with vivid green skin are tentatively assigned to this species instead of to \u003ci\u003eI. arenosa\u003ci\u003e owing to their dark color and lack of sand accumulation characteristic of the latter; also, because in mid-depth reef caves branching specimens may have wide encrusting bases; further detailed comparisons of spicules are pending. R\u0026#252;tzler et al. (2007) decided that the material from The Bahamas, lacking birotulate microsclere spicules and style megasclere spicules, should be a different species which they named \u003ci\u003eI. atra\u003c/i\u003e (Whitfield, 1901). But since its encrusting counterpart, \u003ci\u003eI. arenosa\u003c/i\u003e, also lacks birotules and styles in the Bahamas, we feel it to be the result of a regional condition (of low silicon content?) that affects both species."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00113/00052.JPG","text":"Iotrochota_birotulata_ott114011"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00113/00058.JPG","text":"Iotrochota_birotulata_ott114011"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00114/00076.JPG","text":"Iotrochota_birotulata_ott114011"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00082/00132.JPG","text":"Iotrochota_birotulata_ott114011"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00007/00339.JPG","text":"Iotrochota_birotulata_ott114011"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00013/00422.JPG","text":"Iotrochota_birotulata_ott114011"}]}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Iotrochota_ott900093","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":55,"attributes":[],"images":[]}},{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Phorbas amaranthus","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":59,"attributes":[{"Color":"purple-violet  red  white "},{"Location":"deep reef  rocky shore/shallow reef "},{"Consistency":"soft "},{"Morphology":"encrusting  lobate  massive "},{"Description":"Red to purple, thin encrustations to thick cushions.

Oscular mound or tubes are often joined by ridges. Oscules are 3-5 mm in diameter, although could reach 1 cm in large tubes. Surface rugose, sometimes folded, especially in areas with strong currents, but usually smooth around oscules and in the top of tubes. Color mustard orange-yellow to orange, both externally (slightly darker) and internally. Cave specimens darker brown in the surface,  having edges and oscular collars with lighter color. Consistency stiff but crumbly. Skeleton as ascending tracts of 1-3 spicules, up to 50 \u0026#181;m wide, separated by about 120-150 \u0026#181;m; spicules in tracts arranged in a plumose fashion, some almost in a perpendicular direction (echinating), interconnecting adyacent tracts.

It can be distinguished by the flattened shape of the apex of lobes-tubes and of the characteristic oscules, and definite identification relies on the presence of discorhabds.Sprawling masses with cylindrical-tubular lobes, reaching several dm (up to 1 m) in diameter and 15-20 cm in thickness; some specimens may grow as group of tubes. Top of mounds are flattened, with a central concave depression, several cm wide, containing a stretched membrane, perforated to form the oscules, through which confluent exhalant canals are visible. The surface is heavily pierced by rather wide (1-5 mm) grooves, forming a labyrinth pattern; surface between grooves is flat, heavily fouled. Color of tissue is orange-yellow, visible through grooves and oscules. Consistency is toughly compressible, spiculose, but tissue can be torn apart with some strength. The skeletal structure has not been studied in our specimens, but according to van Soest (1984, as. \u003ci\u003eD. flavus\u003c/i\u003e), there is a distinct ectosomal cortex of tangential megasclere oxea overlaid by discorhabd microscleres, all supported by a loose reticulation of spicule tracts with many single spicules strewn in confusion, all in a high spicular density. Spicules of the studied material in two types: (1) structural oxea, with long and sharp endings, ocurrying in a variety of sizes, possibly in two categories, oxea I, longer and stout, 350-1425 \u0026#181;m long by 9.8-30 \u0026#181;m wide, sometimes doubly bent, and oxea II, more consistently shorter, 210-290 \u0026#181;m long by up to 4.5 \u0026#181;m wide. (2) spined rhabds with two subcentral discs (acanthose discorhabds), with both ends slightly swollen, with rhabds 66-72 \u0026#181;m long and  4-7.5 \u0026#181;m wide, the discs having 8- 20 \u0026#181;m in diameter; developmental stages with rhabds having more acute ends and being less spinous."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01893.JPG","text":"Didiscus_oxeata_ott511196"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01896.jpg","text":"Didiscus_oxeata_ott511196"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01897.jpg","text":"Didiscus_oxeata_ott511196"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01898.jpg","text":"Didiscus_oxeata_ott511196"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01899.jpg","text":"Didiscus_oxeata_ott511196"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01900.jpg","text":"Didiscus_oxeata_ott511196"}]}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":76,"attributes":[],"images":[]}},{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Ptilocaulis marquezii","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":80,"attributes":[{"Color":"orange  orange-yellow "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"branching  bushy "},{"Description":"This species lives in exposed substrata in deep reefs.

It was originally placed under genus \u003ci\u003eAcanthella\u003c/i\u003e. It was also known as \u003ci\u003eOxeostylon\u003c/i\u003e (or \u003ci\u003eTeichaxinella\u003c/i\u003e) \u003ci\u003eburtoni\u003c/i\u003e de Laubenfels, 1934.  Initially, we were lumping together all orange to orange-yellow bushy, tubular, subtubular and ramose individuals having two categories of styles and oxea under \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e. Closer inspection led us to separate the material by the overall shape in \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e proper, \u003ci\u003eA. ?digitiformis\u003c/i\u003e Lehnert \u0026#38; van Soest, 1996, \u003ci\u003eA. ?pomponiae\u003c/i\u003e Alvarez, van Soest \u0026#38; R\u0026#252;tzler, 1998, and \u003ci\u003eAxinella\u003c/i\u003e sp.-\u0026quot;orange corrugated tubes\u0026quot;.

In general, \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e has larger styles I and oxea than the othes species, when co-existing specimens are compared. The most similar in shape to \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e is \u003ci\u003eA. ?digitiformis\u003c/i\u003e; because of the consistently subtubular habit of the latter we decided to keep it as a separate species until further studies; unfortunately, we did not save material of the latter species for more detailed study of spicules and skeleton.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMolecular studies have found that \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e and some other species of the genus \u003ci\u003eAxinella\u003c/i\u003e are not closely related to the type species of the genus \u003ci\u003eAxinella\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eA. polypoides\u003c/i\u003e (Schmidt, 1862), which led to the erection of the phylocode genus \u003ci\u003eCymbaxinella\u003c/i\u003e (family Himerhabdiidae, order Agelasida) to contain them (Gazave et al., 2010; Morrow et al., 2012; Redmond et al., 2013). We prefer to follow the Linnean nomenclatorial system over the phylocode, and thus have decided to maintain the name \u003ci\u003eAxinella\u003c/i\u003e for this species while the appropriate genus name (available or new) is found for the clade where this and other species belong.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTeichaxinella morchella\u003c/i\u003e Wiedenmayer, 1977, originally described from the Bahamas, was synonymized to \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e by Alvarez et al. (1998). Upon closer and repeated comparisons of material, we believe the former is a different species, also pictured here as \u003ci\u003eAxinella morchella\u003c/i\u003e. \u003ci\u003eAxinella morchella\u003c/i\u003e has a softer and smoother (lustrous) skin, stretched among ridges. In addition, it has only styles as spicules, in contrast to the additional oxea in \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e. In life, they are unmistakably different in shape, color and texture.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAxinella corrugata\u003c/i\u003e has been the subject of numerous studies in chemistry of natural products (e.g., Wilson et al., 1999) and their biotechnological production (e.g., Duckworth et al., 2003). It is interesting to note that the above-mentioned confusion between \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eA. morchella\u003c/i\u003e may have permeated these studies and others in molecular systematics (e.g. Holmes \u0026#38; Blanch, 2007; Gazave et al., 2010; Morrow et al., 2012; Redmond et al., 2013). In several cases the material has come from the Bahamas and most probably it could have been actually \u003ci\u003eA. morchella\u003c/i\u003e instead of \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e, the former being much more abundant. Indeed, the most recent 18S Ribosomal DNA tree (Redmond et al., 2013, fig. 12) shows two distinct clades of \u0026quot;\u003ci\u003eCymbaxinella\u003c/i\u003e\u0026quot; \u003ci\u003ecorrugata\u003c/i\u003e that may correspond to these two species. One clade contains the samples from Bocas del Toro, Panama, and the other contains a sample from the Bahamas and a sample from the Florida Keys (and another of unknown origin; see Redmond et al., 2013, file 019 of the supplemental material). As it appears that \u003ci\u003eA. morchella\u003c/i\u003e does not occur in Bocas del Toro and the Southern Caribbean (pers. obs. S.Z.), the samples from this locality are probably \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e; the material from the other clade could thus belong to \u003ci\u003eA. morchella\u003c/i\u003e.  The vouchers need to be reexamined to determine their real identity. At any rate, the results of Redmond et al. (2013) point that the real \u003ci\u003eA. corrugata\u003c/i\u003e does not belong to the genus \u003ci\u003eAxinella\u003c/i\u003e proper.Low bushes, sometimes flattened, up to about 5 m high and wide, with the surface made of flattened or sometimes rounded lamellae or protrusions, often vertically oriented as folds that run vertically for part or the entire sponge. Oscules can be seen in some specimens as small holes (up to about 2 mm) surrounded by a thin membrane. Surface usually velvety, but can be hispid in the ridges of folds. Color orange-yellow. Consistency stiffly compressible. Skeleton as sinuous and confused spicule tracts arising from the center of the bush and ascending and diverging radially towards all surfaces; tracts with 3 to 6 spicules, 40-100 \u0026#181;m  thick, embedded in variable amounts of sponging, separated between 100 and 150 \u0026#181;m; scarcely interconnected mostly by single spicules, thus not seen as much as a reticulation. Ascending tracts are more condensed below the surface. The outer surface is hispidated by the terminal spicules of the ascending tracts. Spicules in two types (sizes from measurements from Bahamian and Colombian material, the latter given by Zea, 1987): (1) curved styles, with some heads slightly engrossed terminally or subterminally, and acute points, in two size categories, styles I, 250-442 \u0026#181;m long by 2.3-19\u0026#181;m wide, the most abundant; and styles II, long and slender, but scarcer, 523-974 \u0026#181;m long and 2.4-19 \u0026#181;m wide. (2) Slightly curved oxea with blunt to acute ends, mostly with symmetric ends, 304-807 \u0026#181;m long and 2.4-21.4 \u0026#181;m wide."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00017/00533.jpg","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00050/01466.JPG","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01850.JPG","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01851.JPG","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01852.jpg","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01853.jpg","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"}]}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":83,"attributes":[],"images":[]}},{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Agelas sventres","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":87,"attributes":[{"Color":"orange "},{"Location":"deep reef  rocky shore/shallow reef "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"encrusting  lobate  massive  spherical "},{"Description":"Orange, football shaped to crevice filling with lobate outgrowths; round oscules with a collar.

Originally placed under genus \u003ci\u003eUlosa\u003c/i\u003e (see R\u0026#252;tzler, 1981). The larger category of strongyles observed in the Bahamas (only one specimen examined in detail) is striking, although their typical wide dark axial canal makes them unmistakably proper.Thin encrustations, about 1-3 mm thick, irregularly extended over the substratum for up to 50 cm or more, often overgrowing other sponges, sometimes evenly encrusting, but more often riddled with many erect processes and tangled cylindrical branchelets with rounded ends, which when fused make the sponge turf-like or massive. Often specimens are irregular in outline or have internal empty patches. Surface of the tissue is smooth, looking porous. Color dark olive green, internally and externally, sometimes grayish, produced by endosymbiotic round cyanobacteria (\u003ci\u003eAphanocapsa raspaigella\u003c/i\u003e-like, D\u0026#237;az et al., 2007) which occupy up to 50 % of the tissue (R\u0026#252;tzler, 1981). Consistency soft, easily torn, the branchelets collapse  out of the water. Skeleton is a vague and irregular reticulation of spongin fibers, 20-50 \u0026#181;m wide, clean or cored by one to few spicules forming 10-40 \u0026#181;m-wide tracts. There is abundant foreign debris (sand and spicules) throughout the body and inside fibers, sometimes forming a 100-150 \u0026#181;m thick cortex, but very variable within and among specimens. Spicules in two types in the Bahamian material: (1) larger, strongyle to styloids, slightly curved or straight, generally isodiametrical, with one end slightly more pointed, and with a wide, dark and rugose axial canal also slightly asymmetrical at both ends, 270-335 \u0026#181;m long and 4.5-5 \u0026#181;m wide. (2) Styles to subtylostyles, with heads slightly prominent and gradually pointed but blunt ends; the axial canal is also prominent and asymmetrical as the spicule, 160-195 \u0026#181;m long and 1.7-3.0 \u0026#181;m wide.

The contrast in color that appears to exist between shallow and deeper-dwelling specimens is remarkable, but they coincide in consistency, spiculation and in the presence of dark granular cells. Most specimens from the localities where this species was originally described (Belize, Jamaica) have also oxea spicules, but these are reported to be sometimes absent. The greater thickness of Colombia and Panama spicules is consistent with the greater amount of silicon in neritic continental waters.Irregular encrustations, up to 2-3 cm in thickness, following the contours of the substratum, and reaching tens of cm in diameter (sometimes up to 1 m). Surface is generally uneven, microrugose, but can be smooth, but always having many low mounds and irregular lobes; sometimes lobes grow upwards and ramify. Oscules up to about 5 mm, scattered, located either on top of elevations or in depressions. Color usually light to dark purple or golden brown; shallow-water specimens are dull golden yellow with tan tinges in concave areas; subsurface dark purple, interior cream. Consistency very crumbly. The architecture of the skeleton is difficult to discern owing to the remarkable amount of dark granular cells that block light under the microscope.

Its large size makes it a conspicuous sponge, and its shape and hard texture usually unmistakable. However, from molecular and morphological studies being carried out by Paco C\u0026#225;rdenas (Uppsala University, Sweden), it appears that it may be a complex of species. Adding to the problem, local populations seem to vary slighlty in overall morphology and juveniles may not yet take the usual inverted cone shape of the larger specimens.  One sample from the Bahamas and another from San Andr\u0026#233;s Island (SW Caribbean, Colombia) were sequenced and analyzed by P. C\u0026#225;rdenas and confirmed to correspond to \u003ci\u003eG.  neptuni\u003c/i\u003e. Nevertheless, some variation in spiculation noted among Bahamian samples from the may need further study to confirm conspecificity. Larger spicules in samples from the continental coast of Colombia are probably due to higher silica contents in the water. Also placed in the genus or subgenus \u003ci\u003eSidonops\u003c/i\u003e, which was later synonymized to \u003ci\u003eGeodia\u003c/i\u003e (C\u0026#225;rdenas et al., 2010), and transiently considered a junior synonym of \u003ci\u003eG. vosmaeri\u003c/i\u003e (Sollas, 1886) (see Silva, 2002; C\u0026#225;rdenas et al., 2010; 2011).Large and thick, inverted cones, with deep furrows in the inner surface and shallower furrows and scattered holes, rounded or elongated, in the outer surface; the wall of the cones may be relatively thin or relatively thick, in the latter with a rounded concave oscular plate. Individuals may reach 1 m in diameter and height. Oscules are located inside the furrows, more grouped towards the center and sparse in the outer portions. Smaller individuals or tend to be massive, with a central depression (or several smaller ones) with a concave oscular plate. Surface in between holes is usually smooth and rather shiny, although it can be fouled. Color cinnamon-tan to brown, with orange tinges; interior cream. Consistency very hard and tough, difficult to cut or tear. The peripheral skeleton from exterior to interior is conformed first by a cortex of densely packed sterraster microscleres, up to 875 \u0026#181;m in thickness, traversed horizontally and vertically by canals, the latter ones being up to 50 \u0026#181;m in diameter. The pinacoderm is stretched above the cortex, being heavily embedded by the smaller category of aster microscleres but traversed by a few of the smaller category of anystrongyloxea-oxea II megascleres. Below the sterraster cortex there follows a 2 mm or more fibrous subcortex with a few scattered sterrasters. Further below, there is a 200 \u0026#181;m-thick subcortical layer of sterrasters aligned with the cladomes of triaene megascleres, whose rhabds are pointed downwards. These triaenes occur usually in bundles, which together with oxea I, conform ascending diverging and converging spicule tracts, 75-250 \u0026#181;m thick. In between tracts, there are abundant small oxea and anysostrongyloxea II and dispersed sterrasters and oxyasters, the latter embedded in the pinacoderm lining canals.  Further inwards, the tracts are looser, with many spicules in confusion. Megasclere spicules in three types: (1) Oxea I, with several styloid and strongyloid derivations, some true styles, slightly curved, usually hastate, stout, the smaller ones thin and fusiform, 600-2025 \u0026#181;m long and 5-30 \u0026#181;m wide, being longer in material from the continental coast of Colombia (up to 2025 \u0026#181;m vs. 1500 \u0026#181;m in the Bahamas). (2) Anysostrongyloxea II (several fully oxea), slightly curved, with one end narrower and blunt and the other acute, 160-460 \u0026#181;m long and 2-6.3 \u0026#181;m wide. (3) Plagiotriaenes, with generally short and sometimes blunt-ended clades, 25-180 \u0026#181;m long and 10-40 \u0026#181;m wide at the base; rhabds also stout, acute or blunt at the ends, 640-1525 \u0026#181;m long and 15-65 \u0026#181;m wide at the base. Rhabds with a single terminal, forward directed clad were observed (promonaenes), 750-2550 \u0026#181;m long by 6.3-15 \u0026#181;m wide. Microscleres in two basic types: (1) Sterrasters, round, variable in diameter depending on the specimen and the locality (Bahamas, 40-53 \u0026#181;m and 58-63 \u0026#181;m; Islas del Rosario, Colombia, 78-83 \u0026#181;m), with spined rosettes up to about 5-7 \u0026#181;m in diameter; developmental stages are smaller balls surrounded by thin needles to larger ones surrounded by conical stout conical spines from which the rosettes would develop. (2) Asters in two or three categories (difficult to discern under light microscopy), with spined rays; large oxyasters with 6-8 slender rays,  12.5-15 \u0026#181;m in total diameter in the Bahamas and 17.5-32.5 \u0026#181;m  in Colombia, some being stout, with rays up to 3.8 \u0026#181;m thick at the base; smaller strongyl- or oxyasters, 5-8.5 \u0026#181;m in total diameter."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00114/00063.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00114/00072.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00080/00117.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00019/00680.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00074/01724.jpg","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00075/01739.jpg","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"}]}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":117,"attributes":[],"images":[]}},{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Cinachyrella kuekenthali","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":121,"attributes":[{"Color":"cream  orange-yellow  yellow "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"soft  tough "},{"Morphology":"spherical "},{"Description":"Previously placed under genus \u003ci\u003eCinachyra\u003c/i\u003e.

In the field \u003ci\u003eN. carbonaria\u003c/i\u003e could also be confused with coexisting black to dark green specimens of \u003ci\u003eHalichondria melanodocia\u003c/i\u003e de Laubenfels, 1936, also pictured  here, but can be readily distinguished by the much softer consistency and by the much longer and varied in size oxea spicules of the latter.Thickly encrusting to massive, often elongated, generally as thick as wide, up to about 15-30 cm long, 10 cm wide and thick, with dispersed volcano-like oscular elevations, 0.5 to 2-3 cm high; oscules up to 1 cm in diameter, but usually smaller. Masses often occur in groups, sometimes connected by lower bridges, sometimes growing lateral repent branches or erect branchelets. On rubble or sand, they may be half buried, showing the oscules as papillae. Surface even and smooth or microrugose to tuberculated, clean or fouled or covered with sand. Color black to very dark green, internally and externally, maintaining its color preserved and when dry. Consistency firm, crumbly especially in oscules and elevations. Skeleton (from Zea, 1987, as \u003ci\u003ePellina carbonaria\u003c/i\u003e) as thick spicule tracts, 4-15 spicules in cross section and 60-160 \u0026#181;m thick, forming a reticulation of rounded to rectangular to polygonal, 130-650 \u0026#181;m wide meshes, often with loose spicules in confusion. Near the surface, it becomes as ascending and interconnecting tracts, engrossed in steps as growth layers.

Continental Colombian specimens are repent, cylindrical hollow branches, up to about 1-2 cm in diameter, buried among corals, yellowish brown, with isolated or grouped oscules, 1-2 mm in diameter, often contorted, with a slightly elevated rim wall. Panamanian specimens are grayish brown and range in shape from lobed encrustations to erect anastomosed branches, which are irregular, having up to 1 cm thin portions followed by masses 2-5 cm thick and then by 2-5 mm wide branchelets. All these specimens are characterized by having a cavernous interior that is visible at the surface where roofs are thin or below groups of oscular openings. The consistency is thus firm but crumbly.

In the southern Caribbean it occurs as long, reddish brown, usually smooth tubes, single or in groups, sometimes reaching 1 m in height and 5-10 cm in diameter, with walls up to about 1-2 cm thick; the surface may be riddled with zoanthids or hydroids; oscules small, up to about 1 mm in diameter, aligned in concentric lines in the inner surface of the tubes. Consistency stony hard, difficult to cut and break, although smaller specimens may have crumbly areas over subdermal cavities. The skeleton is an irregular, isotropic, uni- to paucispicular (up to 5-8 spicules) reticulation, forming triangular to irregular, closed meshes, up to 100 \u0026#181;m wide; here and there, the skeleton surround rounded, 300-650 \u0026#181;m  wide canals. Near the surface, the skeleton becomes more open and more anisotropic, with clear ascending and interconnecting tracts, that end up at the surface supporting a unispicular reticulation of triangular meshes.

Originaly described under genus \u003ci\u003eThalysias\u003c/i\u003e, it was also located under genus \u003ci\u003eXestospongia\u003c/i\u003e (see van Soest, 1984). \u003ci\u003eDensa araminta\u003c/i\u003e de Laubenfels, 1934 is a junior synonym (see Zea, 1987, under \u003ci\u003eXestospongia proxima\u003c/i\u003e). The regional variability in predominant size and shape is intriguing, as it is the especially large local variability at Bocas del Toro, Panama. Whether there are more than one species in this assemblage of forms and colors, remains to be determined with other tools. The density of the tissue, the sticky texture when cut and the skeleton of oxeas in fasciculated tracts is the underlying characteristic of all specimens analyzed. In some cases, there are specimens that can be confused with \u003ci\u003eCalyx podatypa\u003c/i\u003e (de Laubenfels, 1934), also pictured here, but the latter has a more cavernous interior (and hence a more crumbly consistency), more uniformly-sized spicules, a more isotropic skeletal reticulation, and lacks the sticky texture when handled. Another co-existing species with which it can be confused is \u003ci\u003eNeopetrosia\u003c/i\u003e sp.-\u0026quot;soft\u0026quot;, also pictured here, but it is readily distinguished by its softer, crumblier, non-sticky texture, and its more uniformly sized oxea spicules arranged in ascending tracts interconnected by single spicules. Deep-water \u003ci\u003eXestospongia\u003c/i\u003e cf. \u003ci\u003eproxima\u003c/i\u003e sensu van Soest \u0026#38; Stentoft (1988) was recently described as new \u003ci\u003eNeopetrosia eurystomata\u003c/i\u003e van Soest, Meestres \u0026#38; Becking, 2014. Vase-shaped, deep-water \u003ci\u003eNeopetrosia ovata\u003c/i\u003e van Soest, Meesters \u0026#38; Becking, 2014 is also similar in skeleton and spicule size to \u003ci\u003eN. proxima\u003c/i\u003e.Shape varies from 1-2 cm thick encrustations, 10-20 cm tall masses, even or lobed, to 2-5 cm thick branches, flattened or cylindrical, single, ramified or anastomosing, erect or repent. Bahamian specimens are usually encrusting; Colombian specimens from Santa Marta are usually massive; in Bocas del Toro, Panama, there are encrusting and branching. Size may reach 50 cm in lateral extension. Surface is usually even, rugose to the touch, with oscules scattered, up to about 5 mm in diameter, flush or on slightly raised, or on top of mounds, often with a lightly colored rim; massive specimens may have elongated crevices. Color also varies regionally, with Bahamian specimens being dark brown, those at Santa Marta pink to purple and at Bocas from yellowish to tannish to brownish; internal color always cream. Consistency is hard but not very brittle; the tissue is very dense, making it hard for a knife to cut through; very characteristically, there is a sticky feeling to the touch when cut. The choanosome is dense but riddled with small, \u003c1 mm canals. The skeleton is an irregular reticulation of fasciculated multispicular tracts, some 50-750 \u0026#181;m thick, surrounding rounded to vertically elongated meshes, 70-500 \u0026#181;m in diameter. These fascicles are themselves made up of an isotropic to confused reticulation of single spicules or multispicular tracts, often with many free spicules strewn in confusion, in portions very dense and appearing dark under the microscope. At the ectosome, there is usually a \u0026quot;cortex\u0026quot; up to about 600 \u0026#181;m thick, overlying rounded subsurface spaces, up to about 1 mm in diameter; thick, fascicular tracts roof these spaces ending at the surface in thick erect spicule brushes. Overall, the ectosome usually looks as a paratangential reticulation of thick spicule tracts, 20-170 \u0026#181;m thick, forming rounded, 100-250 \u0026#181;m meshes, with erect spicule brushes at the intersections. Spicules are hastate oxeas to strongyloxeas, slightly curved, in a relatively wide size range, with thinner developmental stages. At the Bahamas they are slender, usually with blunt, mammiform, to strongylote ends, sometimes asymmetric, 87-158 \u0026#181;m long by 2.3-5-7 \u0026#181;m wide. Spicules at the continental coast of Colombia and at Panama are more robust hastate oxea with short, acute endings, reaching larger and thicker sizes, 75-223 \u0026#181;m long by 1.7-10.7 \u0026#181;m wide."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00006/00324.JPG","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00006/00325.JPG","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00121/00709.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00034/01151.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02013.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02014.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"}]}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":158,"attributes":[],"images":[]}},{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Amphimedon complanata","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":168,"attributes":[{"Color":"black "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"encrusting "},{"Description":"Black, thickly encrusting; skeleton as a reticulation of spongin fibers with a few spicules embedded in the ascending fibers.

Both have an overall aspect of fouled surface pierced by with orange-yellow grooves, but these tend to be wider and less meandering in \u003ci\u003eD. oxeata\u003c/i\u003e, which also has more cylindrical lobes with wide oscular areas on top; the presence of unique discorhab spicules next to stout oxea makesthe latter species distinct.Thick masses with conical or lobed oscular elevations, up to 30 cm or more wide and 5-10 cm high. Oscules single or in groups of 2-3, up to about 1 cm in diameter. Surface traversed by numerous, elongated, meandering grooves of clean tissue (inhalant areas), a few mm wide; ridges in between these grooves are flat at their tops, heavily fouled and with sediments in exposed specimens. Color of the tissue, visible in the oscules and in the grooves, orange-yellow. Consistency toughly compressible, spiculose, but tissues can be torn with some strength. Skeleton as a coarse reticulation of ascending and interconnecting tracks of 2-5 spicules with many spicules strewn in confusion, forming meshes up to about 150-200 \u0026#181;m wide; ascending tracts converge and diverge rather irregularly, becoming strongly confluent near the surface to form a cortex of thick spicule pillars, 125-500 \u0026#181;m wide, separating subsuperficial spaces up to 1250 \u0026#181;m wide. The pillars open up in a dense tangle of confused spicule bouquets that conforms a cortex, some 500 \u0026#181;m thick, mostly made of the smaller spicule type (acanthoxea). The subsuperficial spaces are probably part of the groove’s labyrinth. At the top part of the cortex there are many foreign particles. Spicules in two types: (1) Oxeas I, slightly curved, often with telescopic, slightly asymmetric ends (one end sharp, the other blunt), somewhat slender in material from the Bahamas, much more robust in specimens from the continental coast of Colombia, 630-970 \u0026#181;m long by 6-41 \u0026#181;m wide; a few true styles are present, but appear as modifications of the oxea. (2) Oxeas II, acanthoxea, slightly curved, thoroughly microspined, more strongly in geographical areas where spicules are robust, 200-460 \u0026#181;m long by 5.5-9.3 \u0026#181;m wide"}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00080/00115.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_gyroderma_ott553619"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00081/00125.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_gyroderma_ott553619"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00009/00383.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_gyroderma_ott553619"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00011/00407.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_gyroderma_ott553619"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00025/01015.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_gyroderma_ott553619"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00025/01017.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_gyroderma_ott553619"}]}},{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Myrmekioderma rea","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":176,"attributes":[{"Color":"orange-yellow  yellow "},{"Location":"deep reef  mangrove/coastal lagoon  rocky shore/shallow reef "},{"Consistency":"crumbly  soft "},{"Morphology":"encrusting "},{"Description":"This is a shallow and deep reef species, found more often deep, usually filling crevices of the reef (both exposed and cryptic) or buried in sand an rubble; it can also occur in sea-grass beds. \u003ci\u003eMyrmekioderma styx\u003c/i\u003e de Laubenfels, 1953, is a junior synonym of \u003ci\u003eM. rea\u003c/i\u003e (S.Z. examined the types). The former name was used erroneously by several Caribbean authors for \u003ci\u003eM. gyroderma\u003c/i\u003e (Alcolado, 1984), also pictured here. \u003ci\u003eM. rea\u003c/i\u003e may co-exists sympatrically with \u003ci\u003eM. gyroderma\u003c/i\u003e in reefs, but it is distinguished from the latter partly for its growth form (usually cavity-filling and cryptic in \u003ci\u003eM. rea\u003c/i\u003e, massive and exposed in \u003ci\u003eM. gyroderma\u003c/i\u003e, although the former may be massive and live exposed in some areas such as Martinique and Bocas del Toro in Panama), the circular grooves (elongated and meandering in \u003ci\u003eM. gyroderma\u003c/i\u003e), and in having thinner styles to anysostrongyles instead of oxeas as principal spicules. A third species, recently described from the tropical eastern Brazil, \u003ci\u003eMyrmekioderma intrastrongyla\u003c/i\u003e Sandes \u0026#38; Pinheiro, 2013, has strongyles like our material from the Bahamas; these species should be more closely compared in light of our findings. \u003ci\u003eMyrmekioderma rea\u003c/i\u003e can also be confused with \u003ci\u003eDidiscus oxeata\u003c/i\u003e, also pictured here. Both have an overall aspect of fouled surface pierced by with orange-yellow grooves, which could also be rounded although wider in \u003ci\u003eD. oxeata\u003c/i\u003e; the latter is massive, with cylindrical lobes that have wide oscular areas on top; the presence of unique discorhab spicules next to stout oxea makes this species distinct.This species grows filling cavities in reef hard substratum or is buried in sand and rubble, sometimes with slightly elevated lobes, reaching overall 30-50 cm in diameter, and several cm thick; at Martinique and Panama there were massive specimens growing exposed on the reef. When buried, only the oscular areas are barely seen, with the surface as a stretched membrane with fields of oscules over confluent exhalant canals; in lobes, oscules can be at the top, single or in groups, usually less than 1 cm in diameter, although sometimes they can be seen as long sinuous or meandering bands, ca. 5 mm wide, from which strands of tissue are stretched from side to side, the spaces conforming the oscules. Buried surfaces or free sides have thin (1-2 mm wide) circular grooves. These elevated areas in between grooves tend to be circular and are heavily fouled, and become wart-like when specimens contract upon handling and fixation. Color of the tissue orange-yellow. Consistency toughly compressible, but more easily damaged than the preceding species, especially in the buried portions. Skeleton structure (only analyzed in a Bahamian specimen) not very dense, as loosely packed ascending tracks of spicules (mostly of the spined type), more densely packed in the outer portions, where there is a cortex packed with foreign material. Foreign debris also tends to accumulate at the base. Grooves appear as subsuperficial round canals, some 200 \u0026#181;m in diameter, followed below by areas of tissue free of skeleton. Spicules in three types: (1) Anysostrongyles (styloids) to styles. In the Bahamas these are anysostrongyles with one round or mammiform side, and the other narrower roundish, blunt or mammiform, 380-850 \u0026#181;m long by 5.5-12.5 \u0026#181;m wide. In Colombia (see Valderrama \u0026#38; Zea, 2014), Martinique and Panama these are true styles with slightly blunt tips (with a few anysostrongyles), 735-1130 long by 7.7-19.4 \u0026#181;m wide. (2) Strongyles to anysostrongyles to oxea, minutely spined. In the Bahamas these are slender, sinuous mostly anysostrongyloid, with a few oxeote, spined all over but less towards the center, 195-470 \u0026#181;m long by 5.5-9.0 \u0026#181;m wide. In Martinique, Colombia and Panama, they are only oxeote, slightly curved, thicker and with stouter spines which are also concentrated on the outer ends, 299-380 \u0026#181;m long by 8.6-14.3 \u0026#181;m wide. (3) Raphides, which were not found in the Bahamian specimens, in two or three size categories, often in bundles (trichodragmata), 93-133 x 5.7-11.9, 38-62 x 9.5-11.9 \u0026#181;m, and 19-29 x 4.8-9.5 \u0026#181;m (measurements from Valderrama \u0026#38; Zea, 2014)."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00076/00017.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_rea_ott2835493"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00004/00216.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_rea_ott2835493"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00012/00418.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_rea_ott2835493"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00012/00419.JPG","text":"Myrmekioderma_rea_ott2835493"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00121/00690.jpg","text":"Myrmekioderma_rea_ott2835493"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00030/01065.jpg","text":"Myrmekioderma_rea_ott2835493"}]}},{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Dragmacidon reticulatum","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":177,"attributes":[{"Color":"orange "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"crumbly  tough "},{"Morphology":"bushy  encrusting  lobate  massive "},{"Description":"This is a shallow to deep reef species, living both exposed and in overhanging substratum.

In their revision of western Atlantic Axinellidae, Alvarez et al.

(2009) clarified the taxonomic status of this species with material from the Caribbean and Brazil, rejecting the use of the name \u003ci\u003eLeucetta microraphis\u003c/i\u003e (Haeckel, 1872), which corresponds to Indo Pacific populations, and leading to the description of a new species, \u003ci\u003eLeucetta potiguar\u003c/i\u003e (Lanna et al., 2009), living sympatrically (usually on exposed substrata) with \u003ci\u003eL. floridana\u003c/i\u003e in Brazil. A third, ill known species, \u003ci\u003eL. imberbis\u003c/i\u003e (Duch. \u0026#38; Mich., 1864), may be a senior synonym of \u003ci\u003eL. floridana\u003c/i\u003e (see WPD), although Lehnert \u0026#38; van Soest (1998) described it as different and co-existing with \u003ci\u003eL. floridana\u003c/i\u003e in Jamaica.Single or groups of volcano-shaped tubes, up to about 5 cm high and wide, hanging from cave walls or roofs, or arising from cracks or rubble in more exposed places. Oscules are usually about 0.5-1 cm in diameter, with an elevated collar which thins upward. The atrial cavity is wide and deep. Sometimes the walls of the tubes open, forming irregularly outlined vases-fans. Color light pink or lilac, or light whitish blue. Consistency stiff, like fiberglass; large triactine calcareous spicules stab fingers when handled. Outer (cortical) skeleton conformed by a layer of gigantic triactine spicules tangentially placed at the surface, covered by a layer of smaller tri- and tetractines. Below this cortical layer, the skeleton is a confused mass of spicules. Internal cavities and channels also appear paved by the tangential layer of smaller spicules, in some places with sagittal tri-and tretractines, in addition to the normal ones. We could not see in our tissue sections if the canals were spiked by the apical actines of the tetractines. Spicules are calcareous tri- and tetractines, equiradiate and equiangular. There are two categories of triactines. The smaller (triactines-I), have conical actines, slightly sinuous in outline, sometimes with the basal half cylindrical, and ending in hastate points, 105-260 \u0026#181;m long by 15-30 \u0026#181;m wide (at the base). There are a few smaller triactines, 35-55 x 7.5-10 \u0026#181;m. The larger category of triactines (II) has a wide variety of sizes, from large to gigantic, with conical actines (the first half sometimes cylindrical), 500-3050 \u0026#181;m long by 60-440 \u0026#181;m wide (at the base). Tetractines in the specimens from the Bahamas occur only in the smaller class (I) and have the same overall morphology but are far less numerous and slightly smaller than the triactines-I, the actines measuring 120-190 x 15-21 \u0026#181;m. Basal actine of tetractines I is usually thin (5.5-7.5 \u0026#181;m) and small (up to about 25 \u0026#181;m), pointed, curved or sinuous. There are also smaller tetractines I, with actines 42.5 x 8 \u0026#181;m. Examined specimens from Gulf of Urab\u0026#225; (Colombia), contained a few gigantic Tetractines II, 645-1316 x 96.8-219 \u0026#181;m (Valderrama, 2001; see also Valderrama et al., 2009). Additionally, in some parts of the sponge (which may not be included in the sample processed for spicule analysis but are visible in thick sections of tissue), there are sagittal (one actine long, the other two smaller and symmetrical) tri- and tetractines, with the long actine 125-180 \u0026#181;m by 12-18 \u0026#181;m, and the smaller actines bent in a soaring bird wing fashion, about 90-100 \u0026#181;m long (same maximal width of the long actine). Their apical actine (when tetractine) is also short."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01200.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01201.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01202.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01203.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00067/01826.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00067/01827.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"}]}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Clathrinida_ott606953","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":225,"attributes":[],"images":[]}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":1,"attributes":[],"images":[]}},{"children":[{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1.0},"node_data":{"node name":"Plakortis angulospiculatus","node weight":0.0,"nodeid":230,"attributes":[{"Color":"black  brown  green "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"soft "},{"Morphology":"encrusting  massive "},{"Description":"Dark brown to dark and light green to gray soft cushions with or without the characteristic pungent minty smell.

Indeed, some of our specimens of \u003ci\u003eP. angulospiculatus\u003c/i\u003e appeared to have relatively few spicules. It may be that they all belong to one or several species (perhaps distinguished by predominant color) in which spicule contents vary ecologycally, from many to none. On the other hand, we have not yet carried out detailed analyses of spicule types (including searching for triods, microrhabds and spheres), to be able to distinguish among old and the many recently described Caribbean species with diods smaller than about 130 \u0026#181;m, which are \u003ci\u003ePlakortis angulospiculatus\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eP. zygompha\u003c/i\u003e (de Laubenfels, 1934), \u003ci\u003eP. insularis\u003c/i\u003e Moraes \u0026#38; Muricy, 2003, \u003ci\u003eP. microrhabdifera\u003c/i\u003e Moraes \u0026#38; Muricy, 2003, \u003ci\u003eP. myrae\u003c/i\u003e Ereskovsky et al., 2013, \u003ci\u003eP. edwardsi\u003c/i\u003e Ereskovsky et al., 2013, \u003ci\u003eP. dariae\u003c/i\u003e Ereskovsky et al., 2013. \u003ci\u003eP. petrupaulensis\u003c/i\u003e Domingos et al., 2013, \u003ci\u003eP. spinalis\u003c/i\u003e Domingos et al., 2013, and \u003c/i\u003eP. potiguarensis\u003c/i\u003e Domingos et al., 2013.
